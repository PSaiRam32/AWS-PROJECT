# AWS-PROJECT

I had Done this project as part of my academic course SOLUTION ARCHITECTING ON CLOUD which deals with the services provided by the Amazon(AWS).

OBJECTIVE: An Application to convert a text to speech(audio) using Amazon Polly.

In this project I has used four different services,

1)S3

2)ROUTE 53

3)CLOUD FRONT

4)AMAZON POLLY

S3 : Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file.S3 is an easy-to-use, scalable, and cheap storage service from Amazon.S3 is a perfect tool for Static Website hosting, software delivery and data archival.

ROUTE 53 : Amazon Route 53 is an available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Route 53 connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names.

CLOUD FRONT : Amazon Cloud Front is a fast content delivery network service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds.

AMAZON POLLY : Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Polly's Text-to-Speech service uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize natural sounding human speech.
